1. Arduino - https://github.com/topics/arduino
An open source hardware and software company
that started up in the early 2000's. I actually have a history with
these funny little devices. Growing up I went not too far from here
for a summer camp and one of them involved bringing Arduino computers
to make easy to comprehend games using "coding", which was just drag
the box to the proper part of the loop. Great experience with them for
introducing me to the coding scene even if the exercise back then was
rudimentary.
2. Doom 3 - https://github.com/TTimo/doom3.gpl/blob/master/neo/tools/common/PropTree/PropTreeList.cpp
For those who live under a rock, Doom 3 is a survival horror game
that came out in the mid to early 2000's that was horrifying and 
satisfyingly gorey all the same. I chose this game as an example
becuase when I was scrolling through the PropTreelist page I thought
it was interesting how a lot of the code in functions was being
computed by other functions and seeing designing tools like the brush
and invalidate from PP1 waas pretty neat. Also seeing how their syntax
system works is always interesting to me.
3.Warzone 2100 -https://github.com/Warzone2100/warzone2100/tree/master/tools/map
Like many other games and other pieces of media around the 
turn of the century, Warzone 2100 was a strategy game that's in
the setting of the impending doom of a nuclear conflict and the 
effects on the world and society as a whole. While looking through some
of the code, I thought that it was pretty neat that the developers left
a whole series of notes and charts to show what's neccesary for the
code to function and even has helper tools to assist someone who hasn't
worked on this game before get started.
4. Doom for IOS - https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM-iOS
Being the father to the game mentioned above, I only really mentioned
this project soley due to the fact that Doom got recreated for some
of the first IOS devices such as the IPod touch and IPhone. Also a
pattern I've noticed is that profesionals code is very concise and clear.
Something I wanna immitate in my code.
5. Discord Red Bot - https://github.com/Cog-Creators/Red-DiscordBot
I've always been interested in creating a discord bot for my 
friend's server to play music and other stuff and seeing how easy it is
to set up on the manual versus how difficult the backend code is makes 
me as a user appeciate how much work developers put in.
